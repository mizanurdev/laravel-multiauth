# Laravel 11 Multi Authentication System

This project implements a **Multi-Authentication System** in Laravel 11, allowing for three types of users: **Master**, **Admin**, and **User**. Each type of user has access to their own dashboard and cannot access the URLs of other user types. This is a simple but effective multi-auth setup for role-based access control.
